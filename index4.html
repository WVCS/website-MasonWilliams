     <br>
     <h10> Mason is the master of the Google Snake Game and Google Pac Man. 
       <br>
       He has refined his skills through much practice. This man is very kind but occasionally 
       <br>
       makes an off color comment that turns heads.

     <br>
     <h10>
          Brooke is the cupcake and skittle provider of the group.
       <br>
      She usually beats Mason at the Mini. Her computer is always in a 
       <br>
       different position
       due to Jacob's fiddling.

     <h10>
        Jacob is a spaz and the least productive member of the corner.
       <br>
       His ADHD results in him not getting much done and also disrtacting others by
       <br>
       moving their computers up and down. We love our special Jacob. 
       <br>

     <br>
     <h10>
        Ryan is a goofy guy and often makes jokes that land flat.
       <br>
       He's a runner, he's a track star, but he actually does pole vault. 
       <br>
      Unfortuanlly he sucks at the game digits.
